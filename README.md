## Data Collection

1. **Surgical Records**  
   - Objective: Gather comprehensive data on past surgeries.
   - Details:
     - Types of surgeries conducted.
     - Anonymized patient details.
     - Medications administered during each surgery.

2. **Medicine Inventories**  
   - Objective: Maintain an updated record of medicine inventories.
   - Details:
     - Track consumption rates of medicines.
     - Monitor expiry dates to reduce wastage.
     - Understand costs associated with each medicine for better budgeting.

(Include any tools, software, or methods you're using for data collection)
